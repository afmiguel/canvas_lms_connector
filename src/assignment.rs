/// Structure to hold detailed information about an assignment in the Canvas system.
///
/// This struct is essential for representing an assignment in the context of the Canvas Learning Management System (LMS).
/// It includes several fields to store the key details of an assignment, and a shared reference to the `CourseInfo` structure,
/// connecting the assignment with its associated course and enabling API interactions.
///
/// Fields:
/// - `id`: Unique identifier for the assignment in the Canvas system.
/// - `name`: The name of the assignment.
/// - `description`: Optional detailed description of the assignment.
/// - `course_info`: A thread-safe reference (`Arc`) to the `CourseInfo` struct, which contains course-specific details and API credentials.
///
/// The use of `Arc<CourseInfo>` ensures that the `CourseInfo` data can be safely shared and accessed across multiple threads,
/// which is crucial for concurrent processing in web applications or multi-threaded environments.

/// High-level structure representing an assignment within the Canvas Learning Management System.
///
/// This struct serves as a wrapper around the `AssignmentInfo` struct, providing a more abstracted representation
/// of an assignment. It is particularly useful in scenarios where assignment-related operations are performed,
/// such as fetching, updating, or displaying assignment details. The use of `Arc<AssignmentInfo>` allows for efficient
/// sharing and management of `AssignmentInfo` data across different components or threads of an application.

/// Fields:
/// - `info`: A thread-safe, shared reference (`Arc`) to an `AssignmentInfo` instance. This encapsulates all the
///   detailed information about the assignment, such as its ID, name, description, and related course information.
///
/// The `Assignment` struct is a fundamental part of any application that interacts with the Canvas API for assignment-related
/// functionalities, simplifying the handling of assignments and their associated data.
